# Algorithms and Data Structures

*We use the **algs4** library by Sedgewick & Wayne from a Princeton course.*

Here's a summary of each EP (programming exercise):

1. *ST.java*
    Implement a simple symbol table in Java using simple arrays;

2. *BulgingSquares.java*
    Implement a program to draw the following optical illusion, using StdDraw;

3. *LinkedListST.java*
    Implements an ordered symbol table using a linked list;

4. *Tail.java*
    Implements the [Tail](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html) application, to read the *n-th* last lines of file(s);

5. *Percolation*
    Implements a percolation model to check if a given ***n** x **n*** matrix percolates. It uses a union find data structure and has a visualizer to show the percolation interactively. This assignment can be seen [here!](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos226/assignments/percolation.html)

6. *Deque and Randomized queues*
    Implements two simple data structures using array and doubly linked list, and a unit test. The assignment is [here!](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos226/assignments/queues.html)
